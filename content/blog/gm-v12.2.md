### New Canary Fixes

All mods, including GooseMod, were broken but now most things should be working fine. You may have some minor issues with GooseMod or issues with some plugins, if so feel free to report in our Discord, we'll continue to roll out some small hotfixes over the next week.

### General Hotfixes
- **Fixed GM reset option.**
- **Fixed Guild badges.**
- **Fixed Snippets (experimental option).**
- **Fixed modules sometimes failing to load.**
- **Updated translations.**
