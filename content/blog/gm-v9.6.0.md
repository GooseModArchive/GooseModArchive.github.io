## **GooseMod v9.6.0** has been released! Features various improvements and tweaks like Store images modal, new settings, a new API, and other tweaks and fixes.

### Store
- **Images are now shown larger when clicked.** When clicking a header image, a modal now appears showing all the images for the module (with larger sizing).
- **Filter times are now faster.** It should be about twice as fast due to some fixes and optimisations under the hood.

### Settings
- **Added start tour option.** You can now easily go through the tour again to catch up on GooseMod's core functions.
- **Other UI improvements.** Purge caches is now not marked as dangerous.
- **Added experimental Snippets option.** More info soon:tm:.

### Patcher API
- **Added GuildBadges API for adding badges to guild headers.** It's usage is near identical to UserBadges, but adding to the header of guilds instead of badges for users.

### GooseMod Badges
- **Added badge to GooseNest server to show it's official.**

### Out of The Box
- **Removed pack modal.** Now just using a few default modules and relying on users to install their own after being shown the Store.
- **Settings now scrolls to show the GooseMod section.**

### Tweaks and Fixes
- **Tweaked loading screen text.**
- **Fixed various issues caused by a Discord update breaking i18n.**
- **Fixed CSS cache keeping old / removed themes, as well as other improvements.**
