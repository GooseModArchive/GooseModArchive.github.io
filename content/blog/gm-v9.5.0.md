## **GooseMod v9.5.0** has been released! Includes a new first time tour, store improvements, and some minor fixes.

### New First Time Tour
- **New tour system.** There is now a tour when opening GooseMod for the first time (since this update). It covers the core features of GooseMod: the Store, settings and community (focusing on the Discord server).

### Store Improvements
- **Added separate imported tab in Home header.** Now has a tab just for imported modules, and a main Store tab for all.
- **Fixed bugs with modules not looking removed / added after changing Home page.**
- **Fixed conflicts with some themes.** Mostly where toggles for modules would show when it shouldn't be shown.

### Fixes and Tweaks
- **Fixed some toasts not working.** Previously toasts without options or type would cause errors.
