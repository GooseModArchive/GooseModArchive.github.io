## **GooseMod v9.1.0** has been released! A followup to v9, bringing various quality of life improvements and fixes. 

### Settings Improvements

- **Home now has improved loading.** Should be faster and no longer showing it's loading for the rest of time.
- **Settings which need a refresh now have a neat prompt.** Instead of the disclaimer text, it now has a prompt for you after you change them.
- **Icons now have tooltips.** To clear up any confusion, hovering over any setting icons (experimental or debug) now shows a tooltip saying what they mean.
- **New debug settings.** For plugin developers and us, we now have new debug settings to help test and try out things.
