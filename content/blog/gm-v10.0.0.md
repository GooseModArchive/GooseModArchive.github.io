## **GooseMod v10.0.0** has been released! Features a new storage system and rewritten injection for desktop resulting in faster and lighter injection.

### Storage
- **New storage system.** GooseMod now uses WebExtension storage for storing GooseMod preferences, installed modules, cache, etc. This should make storing more reliable, secure, and generally better.

### Desktop Using Extension
- **GooseMod for desktop clients now uses the GooseMod for Web extension internally.** This simplifies code (avoiding reuse / complications) and should result in faster (~50%) and lighter injection.
