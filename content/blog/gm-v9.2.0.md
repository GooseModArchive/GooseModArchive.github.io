## **GooseMod v9.2.0** has been released! Includes a new backup system and more Store and settings improvements.  

### Backup System

- **New backup system.** There is a new backup system in GooseMod settings allowing you to backup your modules and settings. Backing up produces a backup file which you can then use to restore later on.

### Store Improvements

- **Ludicrous speed.** Clicking on home items is now significantly faster than before.
- **Squashed bugs.** A bug causing Store pages to load forever has been fixed, as well as some rare crashes. Store in Settings is also now up and working again.
- **Better sorting and filtering.** Options are now properly shown and applied after going off and back to Store pages.
