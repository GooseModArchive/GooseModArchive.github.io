## **GooseMod v9.3.0** has been released! More of a minor update, featuring various improvements to repos and the Store. 

### Repos Improvements

- **More reliable modal.** Repos which fail to load now show up so you can remove / disable them.
- **Simplified internals.** Mostly a pro for us, repos are now easier to work with and simpler internally in GooseMod.

### Store Improvements

- **Loading is more reliable.** Most bugs for being stuck in loading have been fixed, apologies for any issues.

### New Debug Setting

- **Debug toasts have been added.** You likely won't need them, but debug toasts have been added. This setting shows some toasts on certain events for insights into internal code.
